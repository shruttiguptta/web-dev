Adhiyaman, known for his generosity in Tamil literature is said to have donated a rare gooseberry, with the characteristic feature of giving long life to the great poet Avvaiyar to promote literature. We accolade the gesture of the King and have a hostel campus after his name.

Kaari was considered the most modest of kings and is well known for his philanthropy. It is being said that nobody left empty-handed after visiting him. The visitor who came on barefoot would usually return vaulted on a horse or an elephant of his choice. He called himself not a king but a "rightful servant of his beloved people". Impressed with his credentials we named the hostel, Kaari to inspire the students of his benevolence.

A man of courage is a man with good character deriving from deep-rooted godliness. The value of a man is not his financial equities but it is his character. A man of valor teaches others by demonstration what magnanimity is like. Oori known for his valor was said to have killed a lion, bear, deer and a boar with a single arrow. Inspired by his defiance, the hostel was named after the great philanthropist, Valvil Oori. It was constructed in the year 2008 and can house a maximum of 930 students.

Pari was one of the seven patron kings who were well known for philanthropy. One day as Pari was travelling through a forest on his golden chariot; wanted to quench his thirst and stopped near a stream. When he returned he found that a mullai plant (a wild jasmine creeper) had entwined itself around one of the wheels of the chariot. To move the chariot would mean to break its tendril.
<br>
Sometimes it just a spark that brings on enlightenment and to Pari it came at that moment. Hence, he gave his golden chariot to the plant, and he walked back to his palace. Henceforth he gave away all his wealth. Tamils are well known for their hospitality. Pari's gesture to an ordinary Jasmine plant is a nice example.
